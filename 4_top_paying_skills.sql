Top-paying Data Analyst roles heavily overlap with data engineering and cloud infrastructure.
 Skills like PySpark, Databricks, Kubernetes, and Airflow show that the highest salaries go to 
 analysts who can work with large-scale data pipelines and cloud platforms—not just dashboards.

Python and its analytics ecosystem are major salary drivers. Tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, 
and Jupyter appear frequently, indicating that analysts who can perform advanced data analysis, 
automation, and modeling earn significantly higher salaries.

Engineering and automation tools increase analyst value and salary potential. Technologies like 
GitLab, Bitbucket, Linux, and Jenkins show that employers pay more for analysts who can integrate 
into modern data workflows, automate processes, and work within production data environments.
